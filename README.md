# DEVOPS-assignment5

## PURPOSE
This is to demonstrate GitOps using FluxCD

Here we will define the application that shall be monitored using FluxCD.

The actual GitOps will be done using the repository
```https://github.com/campus-wien-devops/assignment-5-MorenoMarrara.git```

In the second step the base definition (manifests) is overwritten so that we see how several environments can exist in
parallel at the same time.
